class TimerConfig:
    # Edit this docstring.
    """
    Configuration constants for the timer application.
    
    Contains internal constants that control application behavior such as
    display formatting, validation rules, and system settings. These values
    are not user-configurable and remain consistent across all timer sessions.
    
    Categories:
        - Display formatting (line thickness, indentation, progress bar)
        - Validation limits (min/max values, allowed formats) 
        - System behavior (exit codes, timing precision)
        - Character sets (cleanup characters, display symbols)
    
    Example:
        >>> TimerConfig.PROGRESS_BAR_WIDTH
        30
        >>> TimerConfig.POSSIBLE_HOUR_DISPLAY_FORMATS
        (12, 24)
