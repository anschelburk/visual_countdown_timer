class TimerSettingsInternal:
    # Edit this docstring.
    """
    Internal configuration constants for the timer application.
    
    This class contains constants and configuration values that are used
    internally by the timer application components. These settings are not
    user-configurable and control internal behavior such as display formatting,
    validation rules, system codes, and other implementation details.
    
    Unlike user preferences (countdown time, hour format), these constants
    define how the application operates internally and should remain consistent
    across all timer sessions.
    
    Categories:
        - Display formatting (line thickness, indentation, progress bar settings)
        - Validation limits (min/max values, allowed formats)
        - System behavior (exit codes, timing precision)
        - Character sets (cleanup characters, display symbols)
    
    Note:
        This class contains only class-level constants and static methods.
        No instances should be created as all members are accessed via the class name.
    
    Example:
        >>> TimerSettingsInternal.PROGRESS_BAR_WIDTH
        30
        >>> TimerSettingsInternal.POSSIBLE_HOUR_DISPLAY_FORMATS
        (12, 24)
